# How to contribute

Tips to ensure your work has the best chance of getting merged in:

- Feel free to ask for guidance at any time via [issues](https://github.com/jaimalchohan/mini-web-deploy/issues)
- Code quality does matter, but I'd rather we work together on improving than stop you from contributing
- Work on 1 feature at a time else it will be too hard to validate your changes
- Unit tests for all changes (where possible) would be awesome
